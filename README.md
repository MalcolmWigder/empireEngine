# Chess Engine

A personal chess engine tailored to my favorite style of play: the opposite side castle.

## Features (so far)
- Legal move generation and game state management
- Position evaluation function
- Alpha-beta search and Monte Carlo-based move selection (early implementation)

## Status
Work in progress! The engine is under active development, with many features still being added and improved.
This project is for experimentation, learning, and fun.
